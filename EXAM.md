**1.ANS:**
Git is a distributed version control system, allowing each user to have a complete copy of the repository, whereas other systems like SVN are centralized, requiring a single server for version history.

**2.ANS:**
`git commit` saves changes to the local repository, while `git push` uploads those changes to a remote repository like GitHub.

**3.ANS:**
A remote repository is a version of your project hosted on a server or online platform. You add it with: `git remote add origin <URL>`.

**4.ANS:**
A fork is a copy of a repository under your GitHub account, used for independent development or contributing changes without affecting the original project.
